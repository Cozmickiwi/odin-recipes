    <h4>This is the easiest smoothie. It only has a handful of simple ingredients—banana, peanut butter, milk and a dash of cinnamon to make it special!</h4>
    <p>The recipe is built on 3 little ingredients you likely have in your pantry right now. And if you don’t, you can march yourself to any supermarket or corner shop to get them. Milk, bananas, and peanut butter are the essentials. I also like to add a few dashes of cinnamon for good measure. </p>
    <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 medium ripe banana, cut into chunks and frozen</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened peanut butter</li>
        <li>A few dashes cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 ice cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><h5><p>Blend smoothie and serve:</p></h5><p>Add 1 cup whole milk, banana, peanut butter, cinnamon, and ice to a blender carafe. Start the blender on low and gradually increase to high. </p>
            <p>top and scrape down the sides of the blender as needed. If the smoothie is too thick add additional milk, one tablespoon at a time, to reach desired consistency. </p>
            <p>Blend until the smoothie is frothy and smooth with ice completely blended. Serve. </p></li>
    </ol>
