    <h4>With pineapple mint syrup</h4>
    <p>“Pineapple mint is great in all sorts of desserts, in antipasto, for marinating or with lamb. Try it chopped and sprinkled over ripe melon for a refreshing summer dessert. ”</p>
    <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>100 g caster sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teacup water</li>

        <li>1 kg mixed fruit, such as melon, pineapple, green seedless grapes, lychees, Granny Smith apples, strawberries, blueberries, cherries</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the sugar and a teacup of water in a saucepan and heat up. Stir until the sugar dissolves. For a fuller flavour, add half a bunch of whole pineapple mint stems to the hot syrup and leave to infuse until cool.</li>
